You are architecting the Ditronics website: a clean, modern enterprise landing page inspired by Zapier.com. Focus on professional trust, scalability, and B2B appeal with services, studio portfolio, and laptop showcase. No payment integrations, carts, or e-commerce transactions—just display prices/specs for laptops. Avoid generic designs; ensure crisp layouts, neutral palettes, and intuitive UX. Position Ditronics as a reliable tech optimizer for businesses, emphasizing OS downgrades, custom builds, and hardware solutions.

TECH STACK (Next.js focused):
- Next.js 14+ App Router, Server Components, React Server Actions for forms.
- Tailwind CSS v3+ with shadcn/ui for components.
- Headless CMS: Sanity.io or Payload—support rich media, previews, easy editing.
- Animations: Framer Motion for subtle effects.
- Performance: next/image, lazy loading, ISR/SSR.
- Auth: NextAuth.js for /admin.
- Deployment: Vercel-ready, with SEO via next-seo.

DESIGN SYSTEM (detailed for excellence, mirroring Zapier):
The overall aesthetic must be minimalist and approachable, with generous whitespace to create a sense of calm efficiency. Use a grid-based layout for alignment, ensuring mobile responsiveness with fluid typography and stacked sections on smaller screens. Prioritize readability with high-contrast text and subtle shadows on cards for depth without clutter. Navigation should be a fixed top bar with simple links (Home, Services, Studio, Laptops, Pricing, Contact), featuring a logo on left and CTA button on right. All elements must feel polished and enterprise-grade, avoiding any bold patterns or distractions—focus on guiding users through content with clear hierarchies.

Incorporate Zapier's exact color palette for authenticity: primary orange #FF4A00 for CTAs and accents to evoke energy and action; blue #499DF3 for links and highlights to convey trust; green #13D0AB for success indicators or features; neutral gray #5F6C72 for body text and borders; white #FFFFFF for backgrounds with light off-white #FFFDF9 for sections; dark #201515 for headings and footers. Apply colors sparingly—orange for buttons to drive conversions, grays for text to ensure legibility (min 4.5:1 contrast), and whites for breathing room. No gradients unless subtle for hover states; keep visuals flat but with micro-interactions like fade-ins on scroll for engagement.

Typography draws from Zapier's clean sans-serif style: use "Inter" for body text at 16px base with line-height 1.5 for readability, and "Poppins" bold for headings (h1 3rem desktop scaling to 2rem mobile via clamp). Ensure consistent spacing: 1rem between elements, 4rem between sections. Icons should be simple line-style (Heroicons), colored in accents only when needed. Accessibility is non-negotiable—ARIA labels, keyboard nav, alt text in CMS fields. The design must feel like a seamless extension of Zapier: professional, user-centric, and optimized for quick scans by busy execs.
